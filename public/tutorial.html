        <h2 class="tutorialTitle">Welcome to math battles!</h2>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="flag.png" alt="Flag" width="5%">
        <span>At the start of the game, a goal number is randomly chosen.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="paper.png" alt="Paper" width="8%">
        <span>Each player also starts with 3 random numbers of their own.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cards/back.png" alt="Card Back" width="4%">
        <span>Players use battle cards in order to obtain the closest number to the goal number.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cards/basic/times_ten.png" alt="Times Ten" width="4%">
        <span>These cards perform mathematical operations on player numbers, opponent numbers or even the goal number.<br>If you're not sure what a card does, right-click it for a guide.<br>Resulting numbers will always be snapped to the range [-1.000.000 , 1.000.000].</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cards/uncommon/root.png" alt="Root" width="4%">
        <span>While every card is applied to a main number, some also require another number as input.<br>The card shown here applies the i-th root to a number, where i is an input number.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cards/rare/mod.png" alt="Root" width="4%">
        <span>You always select the main number (player, opponent, goal) first and the input last, if necessary.<br>The input number must always be one of your player numbers.<br>If you apply the card to a player number, the input number has to be a different one.<br>For obvious gameplay reasons, cards with inputs cannot be used on the goal number.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="peek.png" alt="Peek" width="4%">
        <span>Your opponent's numbers are always hidden from you...<br>... but sometimes taking a little peek could help you out!<br>It tells you how close they are and how you can use cards to get in their way.<br>A turn can therefore be used to peek at one opponent number.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cards/examplePrepeek.png" alt="Prepeek" width="4%">
        <span>There's a small chance for a card to come with a pre-peek, denoted by a green corner.<br>If you use this card, you get to peek at an opponent's number first.<br>All that in one turn!</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="skip.png" alt="Skip" width="4%">
        <span>If you don't feel like risking a move, you can also skip your turn.<br>You cannot skip a turn twice in a row.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cardpile_3.png" alt="Card pile" width="4%">
        <span>Players start with 5 random cards.<br>When a card is used up, a new card will automatically be drawn from the card pile.<br>When the card pile is empty, no more new cards are given.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="cardpile_0.png" alt="Game end" width="4%">
        <span>The game ends once one of the players runs out of cards.<br>The winner is the player who has the closest number to the goal in absolute distance.<br>Even though you have 3 cards, only the closest one is looked at!</span>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
        <img src="paper_gold.png" alt="Golden number" width="8%">
        <span>In the case of a tie, the player whose 3 numbers add up to the highest sum wins.<br>The sum is absolute, meaning only the value is counted and not the sign (+-) of a number.</span>
        </div>

        <p>Shhh... don't tell anyone this, but when you or an opponent's number is exactly equal to the goal, I heard the number's paper turns gold..!</p>
